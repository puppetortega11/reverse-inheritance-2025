# Railway Deployment Debug Analysis

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**Error**: `ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: secret Node: not found`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Railway is trying to use a secret named "Node" that doesn't exist
2. The build process is failing during the Node.js installation phase
3. The `mise` package manager is trying to install Node.js but can't find the required secret

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### Build Log Analysis:
```
Steps → install → build → Deploy
├── npm ci (successful)
├── npm install --omit=dev (successful)  
├── npm run start:prod (failing)
└── mise packages: node (failing - secret Node: not found)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Railway Configuration**: The `railway.toml` might be misconfigured
2. **Node Version**: Railway might be trying to use a specific Node version that requires a secret
3. **Build Process**: The production server might have dependencies that require secrets
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment variable configuration

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Solution 1: Fixed Railway Configuration
- Updated `railway.toml` to use standard Node.js setup
- Removed custom Node version requirements that caused secret issues
- Simplified build and deploy commands

### ✅ Solution 2: Enhanced Production Server
- Made the server more resilient to missing configuration
- Added proper error handling for Solana service initialization
- Fixed module exports for testing

### ✅ Solution 3: Updated Package.json Scripts
- Set production server as default start command
- Added comprehensive deployment tests
- Created fallback mechanisms for missing environment variables
